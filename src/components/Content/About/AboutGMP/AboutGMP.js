            Gayathri Maha Purascharana requires Gayathri Japam to be done 6850 times every day or 24 Lakh times 
            each year for 24 years. This maha yagna requires Akhanda Deepa, Akhanda Dhuni, Nitya 
            Agnihotra and Akhanda Brahmacharya. The sadhaka also must be on Eka Vastra (single cloth) and
            must follow strict food habits. Whole wheat must be first fed to a cow and from the 
            cow dung, whole wheat must be collected, made into flour and eat the roti (Indian bread) made 
            from that flour. Otherwise, the Sadhaka must take cow milk. This must be continued for the 
            entire duration of 24 years. On every full moon day (Pournami), the Sadhaka can take food 
            prepared by devotees. The devotees must do a 41 day or 21 day anushthana (ceremony) at home by 
            carrying out Gayathri Japam at home with rice with one rice seed for each Gayathri Mantra. 
            Then, on full moon day, the rice collected thus must be cooked and 1/4th part each of the rice 
            must be offered to Gayathri Mata as Naivedyam, Akhanda Dhuni, Nitya Agnihotra and remaining 1/4th 
            only must be offered to Swamiji as a meal.

            <div>Swamiji lives in a serene Ashram in the jungles around Narasimha Rao Palem of

            <div className={classes.WideText}> Swamiji started this Maha Yagna on January 22nd, 2018 
            on the auspicious day of Vasanta Panchami.  On that day, Akhanda Dhuni was brought from Sai Baba temple set up by 
            Ekkiralla Bharadwaja Master. This Dhuni was given to Master by Sai Baba himself. 
            The dhuni at the Agastya Ashram was started by Avadhuta Polaiah Swamiji. The Akhanda 
            Deepa was lighted by Mata Preeti (Veda Mata). Mata Gayathri idol Pratishthapan was also 
            done as per Mata Preeti's directions. From that day, Swamiji lives in this ashram. His aim 
            in conducting this Maha Yagna is universal peace and prosperity. This yagna brings peace to nature 
            and thereby helps the world achieve peace. Since Swamiji's guruji ordered him to do Akhanda 
            Gayathri Maha Purascharana, after Swami Sugunananda Gayathri completes this maha yagam, his son 
            will do it and this tradition is to be continued for generations to come.

            <h4>Who has done it before Swami Sugunananda Gayathri?</h4>

            Gayathri Maha Purascharana is described in the 11th chapter of Sri Devi Bhagavatam. This yagna was
            conducted by Gautama Maharishi when there was a severe drought. One year after he started this 
            Maha Yagna, rains blessed the country and brought good fortune from the resultant good crops. 
            Vishwamitra Mahamuni also conducted this maha yagna with 32 lakh Gayathri Japam and created 
            Trishanku Swarga. In the recent memory, Veda Murthy, Tapo Nishtha, Yuga Drashta Pandit 
            Srirama Sarma Acharya conducted this maha yagna at Santikunj, Haridwar. After this, 
            Swami Sugunananda Gayathri is the only person conducting this maha yagna in Southern India.

            <h4>What is the significance of doing this maha yagna with Gayathri Mantra?</h4>

           Gayathri Mantra's root is the Sanskrit word Gayi. This means Prana (life). Gayathri Mantra is 
           prana swarupa mantra and has 24 letters which represent the 24 tattvas (Principles) of the Pancha Bhoota 
           (5 elements) present in a human body. In the Sankhya 
           Sastra written by Kapila Maharishi, the following explanation of Pancha Bhoota and 24 Tattvas is 
           given:

           <ol>
            <li>
            At first, the sky (Akasa) formed. The four tattvas of Akasa, known as Antahkarana Chaturthi, are Manas (Mind), 
            Buddhi (Intellect), Chitta (Memory), and Ahankara (Ego).
           </li>

          <li>
          Second came air (Vayu). The tattvas associated with Vayu are five - Vyana (Alignment), Udana (Verbal), Prana (Cyclical), 
          Apana (Steadiness), and Samana (Internal) vayu. These are also known as Pancha Pranas.
          </li>

          <li>
          Next came fire (Agni). The tattvas that took root in Agni are Gyanendriyas - Netra (Eyes), 
          Charma (Skin), Jihva (Tongue), Karna (Ears), and Nasika (Nose).
          </li>
            
          <li>
          Next came water (Jala). Five Pancha Tanmatras took root in water. Those are Rasa (Taste), Sabda (Sound), Sparsa (Feel), 
          Rupa (Form), and Gandha (Smell).
          </li>

            <li>
            Next came earth (Prithvi). Five Karmendriyas took root in this element - Guda Sthana (Anus), Hasta 
           (hands), Pada (legs), Vak (speech), and Jananendriya (reproductive organs).
            </li>
           </ol>

        Since the Gayathri Mantra is the Prana Swarupa, Gayathri Maha Purascharana will 
        bring world peace and wellness not only for humans but for all life forms.
